## Introduction

During hematopoesis, hematocytoblasts differenciate into M.S.C and L.S.C. The L.S.C further differenciate into lymphoblasts and should from there on differenciate into B- and T- cells. But, in the case of ALL this final differenciation is not possible: the lymphocytes are stuck in their lymphoblast-stage and become B- and T-lymphoblasts. In the case of ALL, this differenciation deficiency is due to a gene mutation, for example down syndrome or a translocation (12:21 or 9:22).

## Available Datasets

I have found the following data sets. The column '*Analysed*' indicates if I have also analysed the data ('Yes') or I just found the data set but finally decided that I don't analyse it ('No').

```diff
- HOW TO CITE: References must follow the format *First author, Year*. It must be linked to the DOI of the article. The full reference needs to be provided in the '*Literature*' section (see the example of Liu et al., 2015a)

## Results

In this section your concrete results should be described.

**My text**

Here is my bash script: 

```bash 
mkdir AwesomeProject
```

Here is my R script:

```R
library(ggplot)
ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y), data = my_table) + geom_point()
```

Here how I provide some images/screenshots:

(all images/screenshots for report are stored in `img` folder of `00_REPORT`)

A previous report has shown that the binding of the HNRNPC RBP depends on m6A impacted RNA structures [(Liu et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2019.09.032). 

This is how you write the citation in the Markdown language:
`[(Liu et al., 2015)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.molcel.2019.09.032)`

Outcome:
